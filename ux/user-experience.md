# User Experience

So here we want to think about how users will interact with my website, what type of users will be using it and so forth.

## Types of users

By breaking your users down into archetypes, you can better empathise with them and help them solve their problems.

### Myself

I've set it as my own homepage.

### Professional Contacts

Since my email is hosted at my own domain, it's inevitable that people I correspond with over email will look up my website.

I know this because I've had conversations with people that have done exactly that.

### Click through links

If someone watches a video, sees my github via a commit, reads a blog post etc, then basically from any online activity I might put out someone could find their way back to my website.

I've yet to add any analytics that can prove or disprove that theory.

## Problems they are trying to solve

By thinking about what *real world problems* users are trying to solve, we can focus on what the product *does for them* and not what features it has.

The features the product has are potential solutions to those problems and we need to keep adapting and honing those down to closer and closer match the two together.

### Myself

My main reason for setting my own site as my homepage is so I can monitor it regularly.

As a homepage it needs to function to allow me to access common links (email, news updates etc.)

### Professional Contacts

I estimate that they are coming to see what skills and experience I have and what I could potentially offer them in terms of products or services.

### Click through links

These users are probably initially wanting to view the content and then perhaps out of curiosity to who created it, they would come and visit my website.

## Customer Journeys

Here we consider how users will interact with the product over a period of time.
