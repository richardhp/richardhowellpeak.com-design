# Phase 1 - Design

The first phase is product design.  Here we need to think about what problems the product solves for the user and how it does that.

A product is split up into "Features".  A Feature is a logical grouping of software behaviour that allows users to solve an array of related problems.

## Step 1 - User Problems

What problems are the users trying to solve.  Have a think also about what type of user you have here.

For example if we are designing a Todo feature:

```Jim is a busy executive, who needs to keep track of all the tasks he needs to do.```

## Step 2 - User Workflows

What workflows are they likely to want to complete.  These workflows might span across multiple features, but would highlight how the feature being designed would be utilised.

Some example workflows could be:

1. User logs onto the app on his phone
2. User goes to the create tasks page
3. User creates all their tasks for the week.

Another workflow could be:

1. User is sent an email reminder their tasks are overdue
2. User clicks the link and get auto logged into the platform
3. User is routed to the task list page
4. User ticks off a couple of tasks as completed 

## Step 3 - Market Research

Look at the market and see if there are competing products that achieve similar things.  This might give some ideas about how it can be done, or what user's expectations might be when using our product.

## Step 4 - Wireframes

We need to design the basic layout of the pages, what components are on there and how we achieve these workflows or solve the problems.

Have a think about the workflows and make sure they are easy an intuitive.  Think about nagivation between pages, the order in which things are shown, their relative size.

## Step 5 - Behavioural Specifications

Each feature must be broken down into "Scenarios".  Each Scenario describes, with no ambiguity, the correct behaviour of that part of the system.

They are written in Gherkin format, and the Gherkin Specs are used to validate the behaviour through manual or automated testing.
