# 2. rails-7

Date: 2022-11-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want a decent solution to creating cross-platform web and mobile applications, without having to maintain literally 4 applications.  Ideally I could stick to one language for the entire stack, both backend and frontend.

A few options are around for that:

1) Use Dart for backend and flutter for frontend.  Flutter flow is a cool option for quickly scaffolding UI.  I have not totally discounted this option yet due to that.  Also flutter does desktop builds which is quite nice.

2) Stick with Typescript and have an SPA frontend plus Koa backend then use something like cordova to ship the SPA to mobile.

3) Use Rails 7 with Hotwire!

## Decision

I've gone with rails for several reasons:

1) Backend tooling is amazing
2) Seems like SPA aren't that great actually and it's more efficient to send HTML fragments.
3) Minimal JS needed
4) Single codebase

## Consequences

The only downsides I can see are:

1) No desktop build, yet
2) Some issues working in offline mode for mobile, but I think Strada will address that.  TBC.
